[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:16 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findfull_name_message.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "full_name_message", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "full_name_message"
  with any of the following names:

    full_name_messageConfig.cmake
    full_name_message-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "full_name_message" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "full_name_message_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "full_name_message" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
